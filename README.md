# Geospatial analytics with Python
A collection of example Python scripts for geospatial data processing.

This repository aims to provide raster and vector data handling in Python that can be served as a starting point for geospatial analysis.

## Outline
+ Basic functions for handling raster and vector datasets
+ Download and preprocess MODIS, Sentinel-1/2 satellite images
+ Get KMA, NIFOS observed values with OpenAPI
+ Normalize raster data to [0,255] range
+ Patchify raster data
